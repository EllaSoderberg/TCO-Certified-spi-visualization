# TCO Certified SPI visualization

This is the result of my master's degree project in computer sciences. It is a visualization of Sustainability Performance Indicators for displays, certified according to TCO Certified. The dataset used is created to mimic actual data on computer displays. The visualization is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/). You can view the visualization [here](https://bright-tartufo-2b3d4d.netlify.app/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
